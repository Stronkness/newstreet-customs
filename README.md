# Newstreet Customs

This project is a tribute to my father who couldn't have his website "Newstreet Customs" up. Instead of paying designers and expensive cost for hosting me myself are creating this for him and will attempt to host it later on during the project.

## Deployment

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

DISCLAIMER: The current version works properly only in fullscreen mode. The objects and elements are not scaling as intended when resizing the window. Mobile application for the site has not been tested yet.
