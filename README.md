# Newstreet Customs

This project is a tribute to my father who couldn't have his website "Newstreet Customs" up. Instead of paying designers and expensive cost for hosting me myself are creating this for him. The website is hosted on [www.newstreetcustoms.se](http://www.newstreetcustoms.se).

## Deployment

The website is coded in `ReactJS` and uses `npm` for building and run the website. `npm` is included in the `Node.js` package.
The versions when developing this website is in the following table 

| Name | Version   |
|------------|-----------|
| ReactJS    | 18.2.0    |
| npm        | 7.5.2     |
| Node.js    | v12.22.12 |


In the project directory, you can run the following to try out the website locally

#### `npm start`

It runs the website in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

DISCLAIMER: The current version works properly only in fullscreen mode on my laptop. The objects and elements are not scaling as intended when resizing the window. Mobile application for the site is really scuffed and compressed.
